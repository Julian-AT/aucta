## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure following critical path: Auth -> Tools -> Streaming -> Lifecycle -> KB
- [Roadmap]: KB does not block live session demo -- Gemini's base HVAC knowledge sufficient initially
- [Roadmap]: NativeWind v4.2.3 stable, not v5 preview
- [Roadmap]: Context window compression (SlidingWindow) mandatory from first WebSocket implementation
- [Phase 01]: Biome 2.4.10 uses assist.actions.source.organizeImports and files.includes instead of deprecated organizeImports and files.ignore
- [Phase 01]: packageManager field (bun@1.3.8) required by Turborepo 2.9 - added to root package.json
- [Phase 01]: Web Crypto types via global.d.ts instead of @types/node to keep packages/shared runtime-agnostic

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Gemini Live API is labeled "Preview" -- may have breaking changes or pricing shifts
- react-native-audio-api AudioBufferQueueSourceNode is undocumented -- needs verification in Phase 3
- Session cost economics: $0.35-$0.50 per 15-min session may consume 50-75% of EUR 29/month revenue
